Use [Mathpix](https://mathpix.com/handwriting-recognition) to take worksheets of multiplication, addition, division, and subtraction problems, grade them, and return them. Then teachers can give more practice to their students, give their students feedback and see what they need to work on, and keep from being overwhelmed by grading.
